    "description": "Your small frame makes you weaker and more vulnerable, but also less noticeable. You can fit in confined spaces, though normal terrain now towers over you. Thankfully, you can jump higher by crouching and climb up walls by holding a slime ball. Falling and thorn-based damage are less dangerous at 1/2x scale, and at any smaller scale, you are completely immune. At 1/4x scale and smaller, your actions become increasingly quieter to sculk sensors. At 1/8x scale and smaller, you are able to fly by holding a feather in each hand, traverse through leaves and roots, and walk through iron bars, though you are also encumbered by the viscosity of water."
