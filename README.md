# Sizeshifter Plus - A Minecraft Origins Mod datapack
Sizeshifter Plus expands and refines what was possible with the original [Size Shifter](https://github.com/ThatRobin/RobinsOrigins) datapack by [ThatRobin](https://github.com/ThatRobin) aka CyaConnor, although it has been completely rewritten.  It also draws inspiration for a few features from the [Gulliver Mod](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1282337-mc-forge-1-6-4-gulliver-the-resizing-mod-v0-14-3).  Grow up to as big as 8x scale, or shrink down to as small as 1/256x scale.  The inherent benefits of being huge are outweighed by a monstrous appetite.  The potential drawbacks of being tiny can be mitigated with certain tools.  Read the origin powers list in-game for more details.

To get the datapack, download the code from GitHub as a ZIP, then extract it to your world's datapacks folder.  This datapack requires the [Pehkui](https://github.com/Virtuoel/Pehkui) mod to function.
